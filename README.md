# Analyzing-Uber-data-with-pyspark
This code parses data from an Uber .csv file.

The goal is to show importing the file through pandas and then transform it into RDD for manipulation by Spark.

Then a direct import as RDD is shown. A third direct import as RDD is presented, and the file is manipulated in the same line of code.
